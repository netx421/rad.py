Introducing rad.py: An RTL-SDR Control Interface. This Python application empowers users to manage RTL-SDR devices effortlessly. The clean PyQt5 interface allows precise tuning of frequencies, selecting modulation types (AM, FM, NFM), and executing RTL-SDR operations seamlessly.

Under the hood, the script crafts RTL-SDR commands, optimizing the signal processing pipeline with sox and play for an enhanced listening experience. It gracefully handles permissions, automatically adjusting commands to use sudo when necessary.

Whether you're a radio hobbyist or a professional, rad.py ensures efficient RTL-SDR control. The Start/Stop button facilitates a smooth transition between radio operations, maintaining a focused and user-friendly environment.
